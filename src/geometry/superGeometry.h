/// A super geometry represents a parrallel voxel mesh
/** A super geometry consits of a number of block geometries,
 * where the material numbers are stored. It is constructed
 * from a cuboid geometry. All coboids of the cuboid geometry
 * are asigned to block geometries which are extended by an
 * overlap in order to enable efficient parallelisation.
 *
 * By the class access is provied to the material numbers of
 * the mesh. Methods for renaming materials are provided as
 * well as a statistic class.
 *
 * This class is not intended to be derived from.
